 We implemented a field experiment that assesses whether citizens update corruption beliefs when presented with audit information about malfeasance in their municipal government. The video treatment reports audit results for Chilean municipalities; the control is a placebo video. We measure incentivized pre-treatment and post-treatment corruption beliefs of 5,528 subjects. When informed about corruption in their municipality subjects update negatively. Updating is correlated with reported malfeasance and with trends in malfeasance.  We find limited evidence of Bayesian learning. Treatment effects persist after one-month.  We observe higher donations to local public goods by treated subjects in municipalities with more positive audits.

The presentation and framing of information are the foundations of many behavioural experiments. In the case of corruption, policymakers such as NGOs face the challenge of informing citizens about the levels of malfeasance found in their local constituency. This challenge implies identifying an optimal messaging strategy that is sufficiently compelling to attract the interest of citizens. We addressed this challenge by evaluating six strategies for information messages often used in corruption information experiments. Using historical data from local government audit reports in Chile and in partnership with the NGO Chile Transparente, we implemented an online adaptive experiment using a modified Thompson Sampling algorithm (Exploration sampling) in which the assignment probabilities of the information treatments were updated in 11 batches of 100 subjects each. The results showed no unique optimal information strategy for malfeasance messages. However, a loss-frame information strategy tends to be slightly more persuasive than other ways of conveying information about corruption. We also found evidence that more rudimentary information metrics of corruption can be equally persuasive compared to more sophisticated ones. Finally, we do not found significant differences between using spatial comparison (i.e. comparing corruption in a local government across local constituencies within the same region) versus a temporal comparison (i.e. comparing the same local government across time).
