## Literature reviews: 

Inspired on <a href="https://jenniferdoleac.com/resources/" target="_blank">Jennifer Doleac's database on crime papers</a>, I put together a Database of papers on Corruption and Accountability, Patronage, Clientelism, and Vote Buying published in top Polisci and Econ journals: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h9npHc_DpDj_BXzOvZhNH_LI0zJQXVyR/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=105095887186157613323&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank">Here</a>
