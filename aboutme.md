I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Quantitative Methods at the [Department of Government](https://www.lse.ac.uk/government/people/academic-staff/felipe-torres-raposo).

Before joining LSE, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Development Engagement Lab](https://developmentcompass.org), based at the University College London.

I received my PhD in Political Science from the University of Oxford, a Master’s in Economics from Queen Mary University of London, and a Master’s in Public Policy from the University of Oxford.

My research interests include behavioural political economy, adaptive experimentation, and the political economy of development.
