I hold a Master’s in Public Policy and a DPhil (PhD) in Political Science from the University of Oxford, as well as a Master’s in Economics from Queen Mary University of London.

My research focuses on corruption, bureaucratic politics, the political economy of foreign aid, and adaptive experimentation.
