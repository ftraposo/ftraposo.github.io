I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Department of Government](https://www.lse.ac.uk/government/people/academic-staff/felipe-torres-raposo) at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

I hold a Master’s in Public Policy and a DPhil (PhD) in Political Science from the University of Oxford, as well as a Master’s in Economics from Queen Mary University of London.

My research focuses on corruption, bureaucratic politics, the political economy of foreign aid, and adaptive experimentation with a regional interest in Latin America.
